# Inspiration
Our smart grid power distribution, based on a weather data analysis prediction, will make the power distribution more efficient and smarter. It will reduce waste which'll lead to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that will eventually help slow down global warming.

# What it does
The power grid is basically distributing power to different areas that need, and you don't want to do this blindly. You want to to do this efficiently and smartly by taking in input from weather conditions. So that way we can determine which areas need to power the most under certain circumstances. For example, under high temperature, this would result in more AC usage which would result in more power needed in a specific. And vice versa for lower temperature will result in more heater usage and therefore more power.

Some of the resolutions for our smart grid, is that we could reroute power from low power consumption areas to high power consumptions areas. We could also increase power production to anticipate high power consumption that we foresee. As a contingency plan, if one power source goes down, we need to route power from another source. For instance, if we see a significant decrease in rain, this means we won't have enough power from hydropower and we need to outsource other power sources to compensate the loss such as nuclear or coal.
